### Copying API Keys

To copy an API key:
1. Right-click anywhere on the webpage.
2. In the context menu, hover over **AI API Keys** and select the API key you want to copy.
3. The key will be copied to your clipboard automatically.

### Pasting API Keys

The extension attempts to paste the copied API key directly into an active input field:
- If an input field (such as a text box or a textarea) is focused, the extension will paste the copied key automatically.
- If no suitable input field is found, the key remains in the clipboard for manual pasting.


## Configuration

### Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **Context Menus**: Allows the extension to create context menu items for copying API keys.
- **Storage**: Enables storage of API keys in Chrome's sync storage, allowing access across devices.
- **Active Tab**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab, enabling clipboard and input functionality.
  
You can view and modify these permissions via the `manifest.json` file.

### Storage

The extension uses Chrome's `sync` storage to save your API keys. This means that your API keys will be synced across all devices logged into the same Chrome account, ensuring easy access wherever you are.

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Not Pasting Automatically

If the key doesn't paste automatically:
- Ensure you have an active input field selected.
- Check if your browser settings allow clipboard access. You can manually paste using `Ctrl + V` (or `Cmd + V` on Mac).

### Errors Copying to Clipboard

The extension relies on browser clipboard permissions. If you receive errors:
- Make sure youâ€™ve granted the necessary clipboard permissions in your browser.
- Verify that no browser security policies are blocking clipboard access.

For more detailed error messages, open the **Developer Tools** in Chrome (`Ctrl + Shift + I` or `Cmd + Option + I`) and check the **Console**.
